\section{Summary} 
I'm an experienced and self-motivated engineer with a passion for writing clean, performant code. My experience ranges the full software stack, and includes periods of more customer focused roles. Over the past couple years I've been focusing primarily on all things Kubernetes. I'm seeking a new role on a passionate team that allows me to continue exploring cloud native technologies.
